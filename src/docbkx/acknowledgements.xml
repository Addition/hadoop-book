            I would like to express gratitude to my editors, co-authors, colleagues, and bosses
            who shared the thorny path to working clusters - with the hope to make it less thorny for
            those who follow. Seriously, folks, Hadoop is hard, and Big Data is tough, and there are
            many related products and skills that you need to master. Therefore, have fun,
            <ulink url="http://groups.google.com/group/hadoop-illuminated">provide your feedback</ulink>,
            and I hope you will find the book entertaining. You might even find it useful.
