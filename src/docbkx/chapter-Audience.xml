        <title>About "Hadoop illuminated"</title>
        <para>This book is our experiment in making Hadoop knowledge available
            to the open source community. The book is freely available, and its code is open source.
        </para>
        <para>
            We want this book to serve as an introduction, as a cookbook, and in later parts
            as an advanced manual.

    <section>
        <title>About the source code</title>
        <para>
            The book's companion source code is hosted on GitHub
            <ulink url="https://github.com/markkerzner/HadoopIlluminated">here.</ulink>
            Alternatively, the book can be viewed as a companion to the source code. The goal is
            to make the source code project as a set of templates, where one can go to and
            copy a specific template, bringing it into one's own project and continuing to work
            by modifying it accordingly. At least I use it this way all the time, keeping the project
            open in my IDE for convenience.
