    <title>Introduction To MapReduce</title>
    <para>
        Once, while working on an eDiscovery system, before Hadoop was born,
        I had to scale up my computations: whatever I have done on one computer
        had to work on thirty computers which we had on our racks. I chose to 
        install JBoss on every machine, only to use its JMS messaging, and my computers
        were talking to each other through that. It was working, but had its drawbacks:
        <ul>
            <li>
                I had a concept of master and slaves, and the master was dividing the
                job into tasks for the slaves, but this preparation, which happened at the start of the job,
                took a long time.
            </li>
            <li>
                
            </li>
        </ul>
