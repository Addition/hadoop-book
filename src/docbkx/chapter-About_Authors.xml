        <title>Hello from Mark and Sujee</title>
        <para>
            HI there!
            <sbr/>
            Welcome to Hadoop Illuminated.  This book is brought to you by two authors -- Mark Kerzner and Sujee Maniyam.  Both of us have been working in Hadoop ecosystem for a number of years.  We have implemented hadoop solutions and taught training courses in Hadoop.  We both benefited from Hadoop and the open source community tremendously.  So when we thought about writing a book on Hadoop, we choose to do it in the fully open source way!  It is a miniscule token of thanks from both of us to the Hadoop community.

        <title>Rebecca Kerzner (Illustrator)</title>
        <para>
            The delightful artwork appearing in this book has been created by Rebecca Kerzner.
            She is seventeen and studies at Beren Academy in Houston, TX. She has attended the
            Glassell school of art for many summers. Her collection of artwork can be seen
            <link xlink:href="https://picasaweb.google.com/110574221375288281850/RebeccaSArt">here</link>.
        </para>
        <para>
            Rebecca started working on Hadoop illustrations two years previously, when she was fifteen.
            It is interesting to follow her artistic progress. For example, the first version of the
            "Hadoop Zoo" can be found 
            <link xlink:href="https://plus.google.com/photos/110574221375288281850/albums/5850230050814801649/5852442815905345938?banner=pwa">here</link>. 
            Note the programmer's kids who 
            "came to see the Hadoop Zoo" are all pretty young. But as the artist grew, so also did her 
            heroes, and in <link xlink:href="https://plus.google.com/photos/110574221375288281850/albums/5850230050814801649/5852442453552955282?banner=pwa">
            the current version of the same sketch</link> you can see the same characters, but 
            older, perhaps around seventeen years of age. Even the Hadoop elephant appears more mature and serious.
        </para>
        <para>
            All of Rebecca's Hadoop artwork can be viewed
            <link xlink:href="https://plus.google.com/photos/110574221375288281850/albums/5850230050814801649?banner=pwa">here</link>.
